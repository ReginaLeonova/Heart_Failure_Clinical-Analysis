❤️ Heart Failure Clinical Analysis

🎯 Goal
Investigate how demographic, laboratory, and clinical factors influence the survival outcomes of patients with heart failure.

The analysis was conducted using the Heart_Failure_Clinical_Analysis dataset.
🧠 Hypothesis
Patients with impaired kidney function (high serum creatinine) and lower ejection fraction have a higher risk of death.

📊 Findings
The hypothesis was partially confirmed.
The analysis revealed that serum creatinine and age are the strongest predictors of increased mortality risk.
Patients with high creatinine levels (indicating kidney dysfunction) and older age showed significantly higher death rates.
Conversely, higher ejection fraction — a measure of how well the heart pumps blood — was associated with better survival outcomes, supporting its role as a protective factor.
Longer follow-up time also correlated with lower mortality, suggesting that continuous medical monitoring contributes to better prognosis.
Interestingly, conditions such as diabetes and anaemia, while clinically relevant, showed weaker correlations with mortality in this dataset.
This suggests that cardiac and renal indicators have a more direct impact on patient outcomes than metabolic or blood-related factors alone.

⚠️ Limitations:
The dataset includes a relatively small sample size (299 patients) and lacks certain variables such as medication details or treatment history, which could refine the analysis.
Expanding the dataset or incorporating longitudinal data could improve model accuracy and predictive insights.

📈 Dashboard Insights
Analysis through Tableau revealed several key patterns:
Age: Elderly patients (60–70 years) exhibit the highest death rate.
Serum Creatinine: Mortality increases consistently with higher creatinine levels.
Ejection Fraction: No clear linear correlation, but lower fractions generally indicate worse outcomes.
Diabetes and Sex: Male patients with diabetes show slightly higher mortality rates.

Overall, the findings highlight the critical importance of kidney and heart function in predicting mortality among heart failure patients.
