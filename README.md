Using exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling, the project examined relationships between demographic, laboratory, and clinical variables — such as age, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and follow-up time — and their impact on patient mortality.

Key Findings:

Serum creatinine and age were the strongest predictors of increased mortality risk.

Ejection fraction and follow-up time had significant protective effects, indicating better heart function and patient stability.

The analysis highlighted the importance of kidney and cardiac performance metrics in predicting heart failure outcomes.
