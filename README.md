Heart_Failure_Clinical_Analysis

Understanding how demographic, laboratory, and clinical factors influence patient survival outcomes in heart failure cases.

Overall, the analysis suggests that renal and cardiac function indicators play a much greater role in predicting patient mortality than other clinical or lifestyle factors.

The strongest predictors of death were serum creatinine levels and age. Patients with higher creatinine levels — an indicator of impaired kidney function — and those of older age had a markedly higher risk of death.

Meanwhile, ejection fraction and follow-up time showed protective effects, meaning patients with stronger heart function and longer medical supervision had better chances of survival. These findings underline the importance of early detection and consistent monitoring in managing chronic heart conditions.

Some results challenge common assumptions — for example, diabetes and anaemia, often thought to be major contributors to mortality, did not show as strong a correlation in this dataset. This suggests that while such conditions complicate treatment, they may not be the primary determinants of death among heart failure patients when compared to cardiac and renal markers.

In summary, kidney function (serum creatinine), heart performance (ejection fraction), and patient age are the key drivers of survival outcomes. Regular follow-up and medical management appear to significantly enhance longevity and patient stability.
